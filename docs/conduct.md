## Why We Have a code

Our goal is for Biodiversity Genomics Academy 2023 (BGA23)to embody the best of
our aspirations towards building a diverse and inclusive global
genomics community. We wish to foster a culture of diverse and
inclusive scientific excellence in which persons of all identities and
from all backgrounds feel welcome, supported, and encouraged to
engage in free and open exchange of ideas. We create our culture,
and our culture is inclusive. The code is a guide to ensure we
preserve this culture.
 
## Who is Covered Under the Code

We value the participation of every member of our community at
BGA23. Thus, this Code of Conduct extends to all communications
related to the meeting and its attendees,
presenters, participants, organizers, including livestreamed
scientific talks, session Q&A, chats, emails,
group discussions, online meetings, and messaging.
 
## Expectations

All persons can expect to experience a safe, welcoming, and
collaborative environment in which they are treated with dignity
and respect in a community free of discrimination, harassment,
bullying, and intimidation based on color, religion, sex (including
pregnancy, childbirth, and related health conditions), gender,
sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, national origin,
ancestry, ethnicity, age, physical or mental disability, citizenship,

We will not tolerate harassment or intimidation
of any person, whether verbal, physical, or
written (including on our virtual event portal,
networking channels, social media, or by email).

standards of scientific integrity and professional
ethics are not welcome. Offensive and

### 3. Report Concerns

We encourage all participants to raise concerns as soon as possible for any experienced or witnessed behaviors that do not align with these expectations. Please contact **tol-training \[at\] sanger \[dot\] ac \[dot\] uk** to report Code of Conduct violations or concerns.

In response to reports of perceived violations of expectations, the Biodiversity Genomics 2023 team will promptly investigate and take any appropriate corrective action. Reports will be kept confidential to the extent possible, however complete confidentiality is not
guaranteed.

Any form of retaliation for good faith reporting is prohibited and in violation of the Code of Conduct.

We expect every member of our community to immediately comply with requests to stop behaviors
that are not consistent with these expectations. The BGA23 team reserves the right to ask any individual to leave the event if they break the Code of Conduct.

This Code of Conduct was initially based on the Code developed by the [Advanced Courses team](https://coursesandconferences.wellcomeconnectingscience.org/) at Wellcome Connecting Science, UK in 2020 and has been updated by the [EBP JEDI committee](https://www.earthbiogenome.org/justice-equity-diversity-inclusion-committee) in 2021.
