**How long will a session be?**  
Typically 1 hour, but a few may be 2 hours.

**Do I need to attend all sessions?**  
No, you can attend as many sessions as you like.

**Will registration be restricted?**  
Yes, because we aim to have highly interactive sessions. We are aiming for < 30 participants per session. If many more people are interested in a particular session, session leaders may choose to offer a webinar format where participant inputs are limited to text, rather than audio and video.

**Will you use Zoom or Teams or Meet or...?**  
We are currently deciding which online platform / combination best meets the needs of the session leaders and participants. We will provide all details on registration.

**How will the community exist outside of the sessions?**  
We will use the GitHub Discussions platform and/or other asynchronous discussion platforms. We will provide all details on registration as above.

**Will I need a powerful computer to participate?**  
No, all you will need are a desktop browser and a GitHub account, as we will use Gitpod.io for sessions that need a linux command line.

**Will sessions be spread/repeated across time zones?**  
Sessions will be repeated at least once across time zones, either live or as a recording (with the opportunity to ask additional questions)

**Will there be assessment/self-assessment?**  
No, these are not formal courses. They are opportunities to learn from the developers and experts in an informal and interactive setting.

**Do I get a certificate?**  
No. See above.

**Who is organising this?**  
The Tree of Life Programme at the Wellcome Sanger Institute in Cambridge, UK is the main host of Biodiversity Genomics Academy 2023. Please contact [Sujai Kumar](mailto:sujai.kumar@sanger.ac.uk) if you have any questions or suggestions.
