# What is it?

Biosdiversity Genomics 2023 (BGA23) is a series of short online sessions on how to install and use bioinformatics software needed for the Earth Biogenome Project.

In previous years of the Biodiversity Genomics conference, a frequent request has been “How do you DO that?”. To meet this need we are asking researchers and teams who have developed bioinformatics tools and pipelines to present introductory workshops focussed on their software.

Attendees will be able to discuss installation and operation of bioinformatics toolkits in real time with the developers, take part in introductory exercises and meet the community of scientists who are also using the tools, building a global community of practice in biodiversity genomics.

# When and where is it?
