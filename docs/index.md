## What is BGA23?

Biodiversity Genomics Academy 2023 (BGA23) is a series of **free**, **open to all**, **online-only** short hands-on sessions on how to use the bioinformatics tools and approaches that are part of the [Earth Biogenome Project (EBP)](https://earthbiogenome.org).

BGA23 accompanies the [Biodiversity Genomics conference](https://events.venue-av.com/e/BG23_registration). In previous years of the conference, a frequent request has been **“How DO you do that?”**. To meet this need we are asking researchers and teams who have developed bioinformatics tools and pipelines to present workshops and demos focussed on their software and methods.

BGA23 attendees will be able to discuss installation and operation of bioinformatics toolkits in real time with the developers, take part in introductory exercises and masterclasses, and meet the other scientists who are also using the tools, building a global community of practice in biodiversity genomics.
